# Getting Started in Unity with AR Foundation
Created for an "Getting Started in Unity" L&amp;L I made to get people familiar with the tool, using AR Foundation to demonstrate.

Original demonstration adapted from the AR Foundation demo at Unite Germany 2018

Full experience is to be able to build a simple AR mobile app to iOS and Android using ARKit and ARCore respectively.

After scanning the area, creating tracked AR Planes, user can click on Planes to create cubes and click on new cubes to force them to spin.

Try improving this exprience by:
1. Offsetting the Cube so that it sits flat on plane, rather than intersecting.
2. Change color of Cube when clicked
3. Customize the AR Plane
